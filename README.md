 **1Pool.finance** is a multi-chain money market protocol for the decentralized economy. 1Pool.finance is building a comprehensive ecosystem for yield aggregation, lending and borrowing, synthetic assets and on-chain options.<br></p>
 **1Pool Yield aggregator** automatically farms the highest yielding assets and distributes the profits among the platform users. Farming is currently available on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain token assets. More chains would be added and a majority of the current and upcoming assets can be farmed through 1POOL. 1Pool vaults ( Eth, USDT, USDC, wBNB, wBTC) are designed to route the investment to the risk-weighted highest APY generators. The yield is accumulated and distributed to the depositor wallets which can be withdrawn, staked, auto staked in full or partially anytime. <br> </p>
   **1Pool Lending Protocol** is a decentralized cross-chain lending protocol built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. 1Pool lending protocol facilitates on-chain lending and borrowing against selected Liquidity pairs (LP tokens) and stand-alone digital assets. The users ( Lenders) can earn interest on their digital assets by providing supported digital assets to the protocols. Borrowers can obtain a loan by providing selected digital assets, which would include stand-alone assets,i.e. BTC, ETH, DOT and selected LP tokens. Interest rates are adjusted algorithmically by the protocol.<br></p> 
**1Pool Governance Token (1POOL)** is the native token of the 1Pool ecosystem. The platform participants, i.e. yield aggregators, lenders and borrowers would receive 1POOL tokens pro-rata for their usage of the platform. ‘1POOL’ Governance token emission is designed in a way to deter supply inflation and provide for sustainable growth correlating the platform utility.<br></p>
1Pool is a work in progress. New trading options would be added on the go and some of the existing options may be relegated or removed depending on market conditions <br></p>
 ##  Smart Contracts,  Deployers, Minters and Treasuries <br> </p>
  Following smart contracts and wallet addresses represent underlining smart contracts and deployers, depositor and minting addresses of 1Pool.finance ecosystem.
It is recommended that users interact with the interface provided with 1Pool. finance website. Direct interaction with the smart contracts can cause transactions being rejected, excessive gas fees and potential loss of funds. <br></p>
